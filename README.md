## About me
To thrive in the software industry, it's essential to continually challenge yourself. At the moment, I'm working on a single project which is list below. By implementing best practices and methodologies, I'm able to strengthen both my skills and expertise.

* ### Trading bot: Personal Project <br />
  I am developing a trading bot from scratch to deepen my understanding of algorithmic trading. To build a strong foundation, Iâ€™m currently studying High-Frequency Trading: A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems by Irene Aldridge. My goal is to design a profitable trading strategy, backtest and verify its performance, and eventually deploy it with real capital. If successful, I plan to explore integrating AI-driven optimizations and scaling my computational resources to pursue this full-time and maybe live on a beach somewhere. :)
