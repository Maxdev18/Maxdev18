### Hello devs! 👋

I'm a proud web developer eager to learn and share new things and ideas. Web delopement is fun, even with all of its CORS errors 😄. I'm very passionate on what I work because if I don't then I don't recieve the benefit of actually learning something. If you may have any questions, feel free to contact me down below(email preferred).

Currently, i'm looking for a job. I'm offering to work for free for 2.5 months to prove myself. By the end, if you were happy with my work and performance, we can then negotiate a salary. Don't underestimate me.


## What I'm working on
Currenlty, I'm working on my own blog/portfolio site. I'm using React, SCSS, and Tailwind for the frontend. Node, Express, and firebase for the backend. And finally typescript as the language for both ends.
