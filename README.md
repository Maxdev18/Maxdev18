## About me
To thrive in the software industry, it's essential to continually challenge yourself. At the moment, I'm juggling two different projects; Inventory Management System for Penn State, and a trading bot. By implementing best practices and methodologies, I'm able to strengthen both my skills and expertise.

* ### Web Application: Inventory Management System <br />
  An internal tool for Penn State to management over tens of thousands of inventory items in storage to reduce overlap costs and to improve budget efficiency and save time for staff members.
  * React
  * NodeJS/Express
  * MongoDB
  * TypeScript
  * Internal tool for Penn State
 
* ### Trading bot: Personal Project <br />
  I am developing a trading bot from scratch to deepen my understanding of algorithmic trading. To build a strong foundation, Iâ€™m currently studying High-Frequency Trading: A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems by Irene Aldridge. My goal is to design a profitable trading strategy, backtest and verify its performance, and eventually deploy it with real capital. If successful, I plan to explore integrating AI-driven optimizations and scaling my computational resources to pursue this full-time and maybe live on a beach somewhere. :)
  * Python
  * Algorithms
  * Algorithmic trading
