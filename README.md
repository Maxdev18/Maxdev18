### Hello devs! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a proud web developer eager to learn and share new things and ideas. Web delopement is fun, even with all of its CORS errors ðŸ˜„. I'm very passionate on what I work because if I don't then I don't recieve the benefit of actually learning something. Currently, i'm looking for a job anywhere where I could help and work on technology that benefits the lives of others. If you may have any questions, feel free to contact me down below(email preferred).

## What I'm working on
Currenlty, I'm working on my own blog/portfolio site. I'm using React, SCSS, and Tailwind for the frontend. Node, Express, and firebase for the backend. And finally typescript as the language for both ends.
