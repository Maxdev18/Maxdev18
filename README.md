### Hello devs! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a proud web developer eager to learn and share new things and ideas. Web delopement is fun, even with all of its CORS errors ðŸ˜„. I'm very passionate on what I work because if I don't then I don't recieve the benefit of actually learning something. Currently, i'm looking for a job anywhere where I could help and work on technology that benefits the lives of others. If you may have any questions, feel free to contact me down below(email preferred).

## What I'm working on
I recently finished my own personal website and that was a great milestone for me. Originally I just wanted it to be a profolio site but I turned it into my own personal blogging site too. Killed 2 birds with 1 stone. Now I'm working on a website for a client. I'm building the front-end on my own and there are a couple of guys doing the backend. Finally a real world project where I'm dealing with legitimate systems and cooperation, the fun stuff. The client's website is based off of a monthly subscription service where users will be able to track stocks using a trading algorithm which my client is providing. The dashboard will consist charts and lots of data will be rendered too.
