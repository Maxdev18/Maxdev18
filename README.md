### Hello devs! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
To thrive in the software industry, it's essential to continually challenge yourself. At the moment, I'm juggling four different projects such as an inventory management system for Penn State along with a decentralized AI compute network. By implementing best practices and methodologies, I'm able to strengthen both my skills and expertise.

* Web Application: Inventory Management System <br />
  An internal tool for Penn State to management over tens of thousands of inventory items in storage to reduce overlap costs and to improve budget efficiency and save time for staff members.
  * React
  * NodeJS/Express
  * MongoDB
  * TypeScript
  * Internal tool for Penn State
* Decentralized AI Compute: Personal Project <br />
  A decentralized network specifically optimized for AI cloud compute. Users join the network with an assigned address, link their GPU resources, set a price, and earn money. The goal for this is to acheive a free market environment where individuals and organizations may perform their AI computations onto the decentralized network for a cheaper cost than current cloud provider solutions.
